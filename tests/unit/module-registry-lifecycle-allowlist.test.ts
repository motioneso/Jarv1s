/**
 * Pins the exact contents of the LIFECYCLE_MIGRATION_PENDING allowlist (#801 Phase A). The
 * list documents which built-in modules with owned tables have not yet declared a
 * `dataLifecycle` manifest (Phase B work). It is a review-visible, shrink-only list: every
 * Phase B PR should REMOVE an id from it, never add one. If this test fails because the list
 * grew, that is very likely a regression (a module lost its dataLifecycle declaration) rather
 * than an intentional addition — update this pin only when deliberately reverting a module's
 * migration.
