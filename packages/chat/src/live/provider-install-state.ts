/**
 * provider-install-state — the api-side install state machine (#342 Phase 2, install-contract §A.4).
 *
 * This module owns the `app.provider_install_state` STATE MACHINE: who writes which transition and
 * when. The base contract (§9, `0103_provider_install_state.sql`, `ProviderInstallState`) freezes the
 * states + the table; this module freezes the api-side TRANSITIONS over them.
 *
 *   - The **api is the SOLE writer** of `app.provider_install_state` — the cli-runner has no DB
 *     mount/credentials; it only REPORTS the terminal `RpcInstallProviderResult` over the socket
 *     (§A.4). Every write here runs under an **ADMIN `AccessContext`** because the table's write RLS
 *     is `current_actor_is_admin()` (`0103:53-71`).
 *   - The driver ({@link runInstallProvider}) sequences `persist(installing) → installProvider RPC →
 *     persist(installed|error)` — the §A.4 transition table is TOTAL over the start states the api can
 *     be in when it sends `installProvider` (`{not_installed, installed, ready, needs_login, error} →
 *     installing`), and every such start collapses to `installing` BEFORE the RPC.
 *   - {@link reconcileInstalling} is the FROZEN stale-`installing` reconciliation PROJECTION (§A.4.2):
 *     a pure function over (persisted state, fresh `probeProvider` result) that corrects a row left
 *     `installing` by an api crash mid-install.
 *
 * MODULE ISOLATION: this module defines the transition LOGIC + a {@link ProviderInstallStateStore}
 * PORT; the concrete `DataContextDb`-backed repository lives in the settings/onboarding module (state
 * lives there, base §9.2), which wires the port. This file does NOT import `@jarv1s/db` machinery; it
 * only names the `AccessContext` shape it threads through to the store.
 *
 * Grounded-on: install-contract spec FROZEN v2/R6 §A.4/§A.4.1/§A.4.2; base RPC contract FROZEN v2.
