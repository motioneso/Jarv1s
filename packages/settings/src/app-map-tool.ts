// our own validation and CI — but the Anthropic API rejects a top-level combinator on a tool input
// schema, and the CLI responds by dropping the ENTIRE tool rather than the constraint. This tool
// was absent from every chat for exactly that reason, while the chat persona was still instructing
// the model to call it, so app questions were answered from the model's priors instead of our
// declared app map. Nothing anywhere reported it: valid schema, green CI, `/api/mcp` 200. The
// requirement now lives in the description (so the model knows) and in the execute handler (so a
// bad call is rejected at runtime, recoverably) — never in the schema.
