// external-modules/job-search/src/web/screens/discuss.tsx
// Task 20 (#1304): Discuss — spec §7's third action on every match, alongside Dismiss
// (screens/board.tsx, a write routed through runQueue) and Open posting (a plain external link,
// screens/inspector.tsx). Discuss is neither: it opens the profile's thread with the posting
// already present, giving the user MatchRecordCard as a LocalRow on assistantSurface.Surface
// while the model gets the same record as structured data via submitTurn's controlContext.
//
// Plan deviation, documented once here rather than left implicit: the plan's illustrative
// signatures name two domain params, `{match: Match, posting: Posting}`. The real, committed wire
// never hands the web layer that split — the only full-detail read that ever reaches the browser
// is `job-search.match.get`'s flattened `MatchDetail` (board-types.ts, #1330), which already
// joins title/company (from Posting) onto the match record. Both exports below take a single
// `MatchDetail` for the same reason board-types.ts re-declares wire shapes instead of importing
// domain Match: this file describes what actually crosses the wire, not the domain split.
import { h, useCallback, useState, type ReactNodeLike } from "../runtime";
import type { AssistantSurfaceHandleV1 } from "../../domain/seed-prompt.js";
import type { MatchDetail } from "../board-types";

// The card that stands in for the posting, both as the LocalRow the user sees and as the visual
// reference for what the model was just handed. Built from the record's own fields only — never
// from model prose, and never from posting.body (MatchDetail doesn't carry it at all: the body is
// what the scoring model already read, and re-sending it here would break Discuss's own byte cap
// on any real posting). Mirrors inspector.tsx's axis layout (L9: Fit and Want stay two separate
// numbers with their own reasons, never blended into one).
