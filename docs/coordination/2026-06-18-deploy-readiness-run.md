# Coordination Run — 2026-06-18-deploy-readiness

**Date:** 2026-06-18
**Coordinator lock:** label `Coordinator`, **stable anchor = Codex session id `019eddce-2ab2-78f0-88b1-fa5d8295b493`** (match `agent_session.value` in `herdr pane list`; pane `w1:p2E`, tab `w1:t7`). _Authority transferred 2026-06-19 from relaying Codex coordinator `019edda0-17e4-77b0-82c9-8e35a9f6dfc8` to this Codex successor; old pane retired. Earlier: 2026-06-19 from relaying Codex coordinator `019edd71-d7fa-7d23-894d-c00bf8ed98ee`; 2026-06-19 from the relaying Claude coordinator (session `eaadc7f5-27f0-4128-909b-55134bba34e2`, old pane `w1:p24`); 2026-06-19 from relaying Claude coordinator `ec808db4-8b97-48fb-9130-07e7d726634b`; 2026-06-18 from relaying Codex coordinator `019edcbd-30fe-7d71-9e48-ded1258b8d98`._ Single-coordinator lock — exactly one pane labelled `Coordinator` whose session id matches this anchor holds authority for the life of the run. Pane numbers (`w…-N`) reflow on every restart/split/reap — do not trust any pane number written in this file as an identifier; resolve the pane fresh by label+session at read time. Agents escalate to the **label**; the coordinator merges only when its own pane's session id matches this recorded anchor.
**Merge policy:** autonomous-after-verified-QA for `routine`/`sensitive`; **`security`-tier needs Ben's explicit merge sign-off**
**Ben security merge instruction (2026-06-19):** Ben is stepping away for a few hours; for security
lanes, run extra GLM 5.2 review and treat merge as approved once GLM 5.2 is GREEN and the normal
local CI-equivalent/Codex security QA evidence is GREEN. Do not merge on GLM alone.
**⚠️ ALL NEW AGENTS = CODEX (Ben directive 2026-06-19, supersedes the Claude-fallback note):** spawn
**every** new agent — build, gate-runner, QA, and the coordinator successor — as **Codex**
(`codex -s danger-full-access -a never "<boot>"`), NOT Claude, until Codex hits a usage window (then
fall back to Claude). The Codex 5-h window is back. Security-tier QA via Codex = genuine cross-model
adversarial coverage (satisfies the cross-model requirement). NEW QA spawns use the Herdr path
(`herdr agent start "QA-..." --tab <agents-tab> -- codex -s danger-full-access -a never "<qa prompt>"`)
since the native `Agent(model:opus)` path is Claude-only. Currently-running Claude lanes (Fix-313,
Gate-314, Build-237) finish as-is — do not kill warm work; only NEW spawns are Codex.
**Relay threshold:** security-tier merge → relay immediately after Phase 3 step 7; routine/sensitive `merges_since_relay` >= 2 → relay. No deferral. Compaction summary = already past safe → relay, merge nothing.
**merges_since_relay:** 0 (successor reset after security-tier merge #315 relay)
**last_alive:** 2026-06-19T03:44Z (Codex coordinator `019eddce…` — #123 PR #323 has QA-323 running and GLM review started; #322 GLM GREEN posted; #322 Codex QA pending gate slot)
**Gate serialization policy (2026-06-18):** run mechanical gates ~1–2 at a time. Concurrent
`verify:foundation` runs collide on cluster-global role grants → false-RED "tuple concurrently
updated", EVEN with isolated `JARVIS_PGDATABASE` (db:migrate grants touch shared `pg_authid`).
Gating agents instructed to RETRY verify:foundation on that signature. Gate-runners must run on a
clean worktree (stray untracked `.md` breaks format:check) and ensure their isolated DB exists
(db:migrate does not create it). See agentmemory `mem_mqk7fojw`.
**⚠️ KEEP GITHUB ISSUES UPDATED (Ben directive 2026-06-19):** as each agent finishes a slice, update
its linked GitHub issue — post a progress comment at key transitions (PR ready-for-QA, QA verdict,
merge) and CLOSE the issue at merge. GitHub is source of truth; do not let issues drift behind the
agents. Issue↔PR map: #117↔#313, #207↔#314, #237↔#315, #236, #230, #123, #114, #254, #255↔#312 (closed).
**ci_status:** unavailable — `gh pr checks` reports no checks on deploy branches (GitHub Actions not the gate this run); judge merge-readiness off local CI-equivalent evidence per Ben's standing approval; security tier still needs per-merge Ben sign-off.
**Continuation note (RELAY 2026-06-19T02:03Z — Codex coordinator `019edd71…` relaying after the
security-tier merge of #313, per the no-deferral relay threshold). SUCCESSOR MUST BE CODEX (Ben
directive — see ALL NEW AGENTS = CODEX above).**

SUCCESSOR FIRST STEPS (you are a CODEX coordinator): (1) claim the `Coordinator` label on your own
pane (`herdr pane rename <your-pane> Coordinator`); verify exactly one `Coordinator` pane = you.
(2) re-confirm this lock line then **rewrite the authority anchor to YOUR Codex session id**
(`agent_session.value` for your pane in `herdr pane list`). (3) **close my pane** (the relaying Codex
coordinator `019edda0-17e4-77b0-82c9-8e35a9f6dfc8`) after verifying its session id — resolve it
fresh by label `Coordinator-relaying` or by session id `019edda0…`. (4) re-adopt the run state
below; confirm you are driving. `ci_status: unavailable` — judge merge-readiness off local
CI-equivalent evidence; **no security-tier merge without Ben's explicit per-merge sign-off** (Ben
has standing approval of the CI-equivalent gating policy). **Update each finished issue with a
merge-ref comment + close it.** Mid-doing: #315 just merged as squash `14793b7`; this security
merge triggered relay. Next coordinator should reset `merges_since_relay` to 0, verify no live
#315 panes/worktrees remain, then continue the queued security lanes (likely #114/#123/#230/#236
per manifest order) without starting any manual #306 lane.

DONE THIS SESSION (Codex `019edda0…`, adopted after #313 relay):
- **#315/#237 MERGED** (squash `14793b7` @ 02:53Z, Ben sign-off). Security tier. Branch head
  `73aa1b9`; GLM 5.2 spot re-review GREEN (`#issuecomment-4748012560`); fresh Codex security QA
  GREEN (`#issuecomment-4748047908`, VF_EXIT=0, AUDIT_EXIT=0, no findings). Issue #237 had already
  closed; merge-ref comment posted (`#issuecomment-4748072559`). Remote branch
  `deploy-237-active-sessions` deleted; Build-237 pane/worktree and QA worktrees reaped. This
  security merge triggers immediate relay.

DONE THIS SESSION (Codex `019edd71…`, adopted after #314 relay):
- **#313/#117 MERGED** (squash `0592fe7` @ 02:02Z, Ben sign-off). Security tier. Fresh Codex
  security re-QA on rebased HEAD `159c447`: VF_EXIT=0, AUDIT_EXIT=0, no blocking findings, verdict
  posted to PR #313 (`#issuecomment-4747694739`). Issue #117 closed with merge-ref comment; branch
  deleted; QA/Fix panes and worktrees reaped. This security merge triggers immediate relay.
- **#315/#237** rebased/pushed to `cd2f5b2` on current `origin/main` `0592fe7`; narrow
  `@jarv1s/module-registry` typecheck passed. Fresh Codex security re-QA is being spawned before
  Ben sign-off.

DONE THIS SESSION (Claude `eaadc7f5…`):
- Adopted authority from `ec808db4…`; closed old pane `w1:p10`; lock anchor rewritten to me.
- **#312/#255 board → Done**: verified already Done (project 2 "Issue and Roadmap Work", auto on close).
- **#314/#207 MERGED** (squash `b0c59ef` @ 01:09Z, Ben sign-off). Security tier. Independent review
  CLEAN + independent CI-equiv gate GREEN on integrated result (rebased clean onto post-#312 main,
  HEAD `6692f31`, VF=0/AUDIT=0/840 passed). Issue #207 closed w/ merge-ref comment; board auto-Done;
  Gate-314 worktree+branch+pane reaped. Non-blocking followup noted in the issue:
  `rate-limit-key.ts:52` malformed-bearer→cookie fallback (QA confirmed NO fresh-bucket bypass).
- `w1:p1N` skill-hardening session: committed its 7 `.claude/skills/` files as `48577ef` (by Ben's
  decision), pane reaped.
- **Uncommitted in shared tree (`ui-improvement-plan`)**: my manifest edits to THIS file +
  `docs/coordination/wellness-design-2026-06-15.md` (M) + `docs/superpowers/specs/2026-06-18-wellness-adversarial-remediations.md` (??).
  Ben says all are known committable session work (no foreign surprises) — I commit them by explicit
  path as part of this relay flush. If still uncommitted when you read this, commit them by path.

LIVE FLEET (resolve panes fresh by label; numbers reflow):
- `Build-114-SecretResiduals` — Codex, pane `w1:p2G`, session `019eddd0-cf93-79a2-ac84-c8df2a9030f7`,
  worktree `.claude/worktrees/deploy-114-secret-residuals`, branch `deploy-114-secret-residuals`;
  local-ready at `27972b7`: VF_EXIT=0 (lint, format:check, file-size, typecheck, 71 unit files/434
  tests, db:migrate current, 59 integration files/849 pass/2 skipped), AUDIT_EXIT=0, pre-push
  format/lint/typecheck green before fetch. Pushed/current after DNS recovery; PR #321 open. Issue
  update `#issuecomment-4748201868`. GLM 5.2 review GREEN in pane `w1:p28`: no blocking findings;
  unsafe credential casts removed; AI decrypt call sites funnel through parser; sync Google secret
  through guard; no secret logging; spec acceptance met. Non-blocking: whitespace-only API key
  accepted; boolean `actorScoped` log metadata odd; pending Google OAuth decrypt guard consistency
  out of scope. GLM PR comment posted to PR #321 (`#issuecomment-4748266225`).
  Codex security QA RED: diff/security review had 0 blocking findings and AUDIT_EXIT=0, but full
  local gate on `27972b76576d4ded72691bee9af047efd53cef60` had VF_EXIT=1 from
  `tests/integration/auth-bootstrap-recovery.test.ts` disabled-registration racer timeout; exact
  isolated rerun on same DB/head passed (`RERUN_EXIT=0`). Merge-ready: NO until a clean full gate,
  Ben-approved waiver, or follow-up fix. QA PR comment posted (`#issuecomment-4748266221`); issue
  #114 update posted (`#issuecomment-4748266224`).
- `Build-123-AIGateway` — Codex, pane `w1:p2H`, session `019eddd0-cf56-7b51-86d5-56bed1e8b7e1`,
  worktree `.claude/worktrees/deploy-123-ai-gateway-hardening`, branch
  `deploy-123-ai-gateway-hardening`; plan approved; building. Task 1 committed `5a4f978`
  (immediate-approve red→green); Task 2 committed `77f6f36` (stale pending cleanup red→green,
  migration-owner SELECT/UPDATE policies under FORCE RLS); Task 3 committed `8f29273` (Codex token
  env file 0600 + rm on kill, redaction preserved); verification cleanup committed `b131b64`.
  Scoped startup fix committed `49b1078` (stale cleanup is nonfatal when DB is down). PR #323 open:
  https://github.com/motioneso/Jarv1s/pull/323, head `49b10785ec76a43db7088ac8bb98312835f3050f`,
  mergeStateStatus CLEAN. Build evidence: VF_EXIT=0 on rerun with
  `JARVIS_PGDATABASE=jarv1s_deploy123`; AUDIT_EXIT=0; focused
  mcp-gateway/chat-mcp-transport/chat-live integration PASS; cli/mux/redact/gateway unit PASS.
  First full VF hit unrelated auth-bootstrap racer timeout; focused auth-bootstrap-recovery rerun
  PASS and second full VF PASS. Issue #123 progress comment posted (`#issuecomment-4748313718`).
  Assigned migration `packages/ai/sql/0098_ai_cancel_stale_assistant_actions.sql`.
- `QA-323-AIGateway` — Codex, pane `w1:p2M`, session `019eddfa-720a-7341-aef6-5e1a23f57e00`,
  worktree `.claude/worktrees/qa-323-ai-gateway-hardening`, detached at PR #323 head `49b1078`;
  security QA running with CI-unavailable local gate requirement (`JARVIS_PGDATABASE=jarv1s_qa_323`).
  GLM 5.2 static security review also started in pane `w1:p28`.
- `QA-321-SecretResiduals` — Codex, pane `w1:p2K`, session `019edde0-e277-7962-b29f-e0bc30ad1407`,
  worktree `.claude/worktrees/qa-321-secret-residuals`, detached at PR #321 head `27972b7`;
  security QA returned RED with CI-unavailable local gate requirement: after an initial missing-DB
  setup failure, full verify rerun had VF_EXIT=1 on the disabled-registration racer timeout,
  AUDIT_EXIT=0, and isolated rerun of the exact failing test passed (`RERUN_EXIT=0`). PR comment
  blocked by DNS.
- `Build-230-PeopleAccess` — Codex, pane `w1:p2J`, session `019eddd0-cfbf-7f83-849a-2d1dbea73abf`,
  worktree `.claude/worktrees/deploy-230-people-access-sessions`, branch
  `deploy-230-people-access-sessions`; local-ready at `85e078f` (format/lint/typecheck/unit green;
  focused e2e green before scoped Prettier; post-format e2e retry hit local EMFILE watcher, not app
  assertion). Pushed/current after DNS recovery; PR #322 open. Issue update
  `#issuecomment-4748201877`. GLM 5.2 security review GREEN and posted to PR #322
  (`#issuecomment-4748280238`): no blocking findings; real backend route and server-side admin
  enforcement confirmed; fake Invite removed; no session/token leakage found; non-blocking notes
  are typed response threading, optional backend self-revoke guard, and Codex QA should confirm the
  e2e after prior local EMFILE. Codex QA not yet started because #123 gate/fix cycle is occupying
  the serialized local gate slot.
- GLM 5.2 pane `w1:p28` is not a deploy build lane; it may still be open for
  unrelated/adversarial-review work.

GATE SERIALIZATION RIGHT NOW: no CI-equiv gate is running. #315 merged; relay now.

PENDING SIGN-OFFS (all security tier, all need Ben): none currently ready. Continue serialized successors per chains A/B/C and the held queue (#114, #123, #230, #236,
#254, then #306 manual). Preferred merge order: #117(#313), #114, #207(#314 ✅done), #123, #237(#315),
#230, #236, #255(#312 ✅done), #254, then #306.

GATE DISCIPLINE: serialize mechanical gates ~1–2 at a time; retry verify:foundation on "tuple
concurrently updated" (cluster-global grants contention — see agentmemory `mem_mqk7fojw`); gate-runners
need a clean worktree + a pre-existing isolated DB. Per-merge digest:
- **#312 host-diagnostics (#255) → MERGED**, security, VF=0/AUDIT=0 @ b4b61e5, Ben-signed.
- **#314 rate-limit gates (#207) → MERGED** squash `b0c59ef` @ 2026-06-19T01:09Z, security, VF=0/AUDIT=0
  on integrated result `6692f31`, Ben-signed. Issue closed; board auto-Done.

## Phase 0 Readiness

- Coordinator lock: claimed; exactly one Herdr pane labelled `Coordinator`.
- Codex usage watch: self pane read on 2026-06-18 showed `5h 27% left`. If this drops near zero
  before the Codex 5-hour window resets, hand off coordination to a Claude coordinator in the same
  Herdr tab and instruct it to spawn/use Claude build and QA agents until Codex resets.
- Codex usage watch update: self pane read later showed `5h 10% left`; coordinator relay to Claude is
  in progress.
- Main gate: **blocked**. Ben's wrap-up reports local `pnpm verify:foundation` exit 1 from briefing
  worker timeouts in `tests/integration/briefings-synthesis.test.ts` and
  `tests/integration/briefings.test.ts`; `pnpm audit:release-hardening` exit 0.
- Checkout note: coordinator pane is currently on branch `ui-improvement-plan` at `adf957b`; `origin/main` is `32b898f`.
- Spec gate: cleared locally by restoring seven approved deploy-readiness specs from reflog commit
  `45f46f9d63add32bed0def5077042aee7ad78b55` after they were dropped from refs.
- Spawn policy: **do not spawn deploy feature agents** until the briefing timeout gate is fixed and
  the integrated gate is green. A narrow `gate-fix-briefings` agent may run first to restore the
  green baseline.

## Dependency / Merge Order

- **Hard blockers before deploy feature spawn:** cleared if feature agents use isolated `JARVIS_PGDATABASE` values. Briefing timeout root cause was shared `jarv1s` DB contention with a live `dev:worker`, not a code failure.
- **Serialized security chain A:** #117 → #114. Reason: deployment secret/bootstrap hardening should land before adjacent secret/vault residual work.
- **Serialized security chain B:** #207 → #123. Reason: shared auth/token/rate-limit/MCP/AI tool surface; #123 depends on token-launch hardening not fighting rate-limit policy changes.
- **Serialized account/session chain C:** #237 → #230 → #236. Reason: #230 exposes admin revoke sessions UI and #236 may link to real active sessions if #237 has landed.
- **Ops chain D:** #255 can run independently once `main` is green; #254 can run independently but lands after any connector/secret residual if #114 changes shared connector secret guards. #255 and #254 both touch admin settings UI; serialize unless handoffs assign non-overlapping files or the agents coordinate `apps/web/src/settings/settings-admin-panes.tsx`.
- **Final manual gate:** #306 runs only after Phase 1 prerequisite stack is merged and deployed.
- **Preferred merge order:** #117, #114, #207, #123, #237, #230, #236, #255, #254, then #306 manual acceptance.

## CI Waivers

No waivers.

| <none> | —   | —                          | —     | —            |

## Outstanding Escalations

- [x] Briefing integration timeout gate investigated. Root cause was shared `jarv1s` DB contention
      with a live `dev:worker`; `JARVIS_PGDATABASE=jarv1s_gatefix pnpm test:briefings` passed 5x.
      Feature lanes must use isolated `JARVIS_PGDATABASE` values.
- [x] #312 security QA GREEN verdict posted to PR #312 (`#issuecomment-4747231184`) by Claude
      coordinator now that `gh` is reachable; `gh pr checks 312` = no checks (CI-unavailable).
      REMAINING before merge: (a) spawn a CI-equivalent gate-runner to produce GREEN
      `verify:foundation`+`audit:release-hardening` on the #312 merge result (QA did not run the
      mechanical gate locally), then (b) Ben's explicit security-tier merge sign-off.
- [x] #313 prior security QA was RED (decode bug). **FIX LANDED** by `Fix-313-RolePw`:
      `role-bootstrap.ts` now `decodeURIComponent(url.password)`, TDD red→green +1 unit test, VF=0/AUDIT=0,
      rebased on main HEAD `3c8d0c7`, PR #313 updated. **CODEX re-QA GREEN** (`QA-313-RolePw`, w1:p25,
      worktree `.claude/worktrees/qa-313-rolepw`, ground `3c8d0c7`) — verdict posted to PR #313
      (VF_EXIT=0, AUDIT_EXIT=0, no blocking findings, merge-ready). Ben sign-off received 2026-06-19.
      Because #314 landed after that verdict, coordinator rebased #313 onto current `origin/main`
      (`b0c59ef`) as HEAD `159c447`, pushed it, and `pnpm vitest run
      tests/unit/role-bootstrap.test.ts` passed 7/7. Fresh Codex re-QA GREEN (VF_EXIT=0/AUDIT_EXIT=0,
      no blocking findings). **MERGED** squash `0592fe7`; issue #117 closed; panes/worktrees reaped.
- [x] #314 security QA review **CLEAN**; clean re-gate GREEN on integrated result (`6692f31`, VF=0/AUDIT=0).
      **MERGED** squash `b0c59ef` @ 01:09Z with Ben sign-off; issue #207 closed + board Done; Gate-314 reaped.
      Non-blocking spec-drift `rate-limit-key.ts:52` (malformed-bearer→cookie, no fresh-bucket bypass)
      recorded in the issue as a followup.
- [x] #315/#237 **MERGED** (squash `14793b7` @ 02:53Z, Ben sign-off). Security QA history: previous verdict; invariants ok; 1 non-blocking: cookie-session current-id
      path `session-service.ts:62` untested). RED was stale-branch only; Build-237 rebased to `4271bb6`
      before #314 merged. Coordinator locally rebased #315 onto current `origin/main` (`b0c59ef`):
      new HEAD `7d2b989`, stale docs commits dropped, one trivial import conflict resolved,
      `@jarv1s/module-registry` typecheck green, and pushed. #313 then merged as `0592fe7`, so
      #315 was stale again. Successor rebased cleanly onto `0592fe7`, new HEAD `cd2f5b2`, reran
      `@jarv1s/module-registry` typecheck green, pushed, and posted progress comment
      `#issuecomment-4747787641`. Fresh Codex re-QA GREEN in `QA-315-Sessions-ReQA`: VF_EXIT=0,
      AUDIT_EXIT=0, 0 blocking findings; verdict `#issuecomment-4747834636`; issue update
      `#issuecomment-4747838200`. Ben requested GLM 5.2 review before sign-off; GLM returned RED:
      `app.auth_sessions.id` is the bearer token secret but was emitted as public session id.
      Corrected RED comments posted to PR/issue (`#issuecomment-4747900428` /
      `#issuecomment-4747900461`). Build-237 fixed and pushed `f07e5f3`: bearer rows expose
      one-way handles, raw bearer revoke 404s, focused me-sessions tests 8/8, typecheck green;
      progress comments `#issuecomment-4747937703` / `#issuecomment-4747937709`. GLM re-review and
      fresh Codex security re-QA started. GLM re-review GREEN (`#issuecomment-4747952881` /
      `#issuecomment-4747952880`). Fresh Codex security re-QA RED despite VF=0/AUDIT=0:
      cookie-auth current-session/revoke-others path needs direct integration coverage
      (`#issuecomment-4747979283`; PR/issue updates `#issuecomment-4747984571` /
      `#issuecomment-4747984574`). Build-237 fixed and pushed `73aa1b9`: real Better Auth cookie
      integration test covers current marking, current revoke refusal, and revoke-others preserving
      current; focused me-sessions 9/9, typecheck, changed-file format/lint green. PR/issue
      progress `#issuecomment-4748000470` / `#issuecomment-4748000475`. GLM spot re-review GREEN
      (`#issuecomment-4748012560` / `#issuecomment-4748012562`). Fresh Codex re-QA GREEN:
      VF_EXIT=0, AUDIT_EXIT=0, 0 blocking/non-blocking findings, verdict
      `#issuecomment-4748047908`; issue update `#issuecomment-4748050610`. Awaiting exact Ben
      merge sign-off. **MERGED** squash `14793b7`; issue #237 closed with merge-ref comment; branch,
      Build-237 pane/worktree, and QA worktrees reaped. This security merge triggers immediate relay.
